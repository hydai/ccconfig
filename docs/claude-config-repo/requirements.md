# Claude Configuration Repository Requirements

## Overview
A Git repository for hosting and managing Claude AI configurations including agents, commands, and hooks to enhance developer productivity and enable reusable AI workflows.

## User Stories

### 1. Agent Management

**Story 1.1**: As a Claude user, I want to browse available agents, So that I can discover useful AI assistants for my tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have access to the claude-config repository
When I navigate to the agents directory
Then I should see a list of available agent configurations
And each agent should have a descriptive markdown file
And the agent file should include name, description, color, and system prompt
```

**Story 1.2**: As a developer, I want to create custom agents, So that I can define specialized AI assistants for my workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I want to create a new agent
When I create a new markdown file in the agents directory
Then I should follow the existing agent template format
And I should include required fields: name, description, color
And I should provide a clear system prompt for the agent's behavior
```

**Story 1.3**: As a Claude user, I want to use agents from this repository, So that I can leverage pre-built AI capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have cloned the claude-config repository
When I reference an agent in my Claude workflow
Then Claude should recognize the agent configuration
And the agent should behave according to its defined system prompt
```

### 2. Command Management

**Story 2.1**: As a developer, I want to define custom commands, So that I can create reusable shortcuts for common tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I want to create a new command
When I add a command configuration to the commands directory
Then the command should have a clear name and description
And the command should define its expected behavior
And the command should specify any required parameters
```

**Story 2.2**: As a Claude user, I want to list available commands, So that I can discover useful shortcuts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have the claude-config repository
When I check the commands directory
Then I should see all available command configurations
And each command should have documentation for usage
```

### 3. Hook Management

**Story 3.1**: As a developer, I want to create hooks for Claude events, So that I can customize Claude's behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I want to add custom behavior to Claude
When I create a hook configuration
Then I should specify the trigger event
And I should define the hook's action
And the hook should be stored in the hooks directory
```

**Story 3.2**: As a Claude user, I want to enable/disable hooks, So that I can control which customizations are active.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have hooks configured in the repository
When I want to use specific hooks
Then I should be able to selectively enable them
And disabled hooks should not affect Claude's behavior
```

### 4. Repository Organization

**Story 4.1**: As a repository maintainer, I want a clear directory structure, So that configurations are easy to find and manage.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given the claude-config repository
When I organize configurations
Then agents should be in the /agents directory
And commands should be in the /commands directory
And hooks should be in the /hooks directory
And documentation should be in the /docs directory
```

**Story 4.2**: As a contributor, I want contribution guidelines, So that I can add new configurations properly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I want to contribute to the repository
When I read the contribution guidelines
Then I should understand the required format for each configuration type
And I should know the review process for submissions
And I should understand the naming conventions
```

### 5. Documentation and Discovery

**Story 5.1**: As a new user, I want comprehensive documentation, So that I can quickly start using the configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I am new to the claude-config repository
When I read the README file
Then I should understand the repository's purpose
And I should see installation/setup instructions
And I should find examples of using each configuration type
```

**Story 5.2**: As a user, I want a catalog of available configurations, So that I can easily find what I need.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I want to find specific functionality
When I check the repository documentation
Then I should see a categorized list of all agents
And I should see a list of all available commands
And I should see a list of all available hooks
And each item should have a brief description
```

### 6. Version Control and Updates

**Story 6.1**: As a user, I want to track configuration versions, So that I can use stable configurations and update when needed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given the repository uses Git for version control
When configurations are updated
Then changes should be documented in commit messages
And breaking changes should be clearly noted
And users should be able to pin to specific versions
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Compatibility**: All configurations should be compatible with Claude AI
2. **Modularity**: Configurations should be independent and reusable
3. **Documentation**: Each configuration must be self-documenting
4. **Maintainability**: Configurations should follow consistent formatting
5. **Discoverability**: Users should easily find relevant configurations
