## Success Metrics
- Each task results in working functionality that users can immediately use
- Documentation is created alongside implementation, not as an afterthought
- Validation and testing are integrated into the development flow
- The repository grows organically with each task adding value

## Notes
- Tasks are ordered to deliver value quickly while building a solid foundation
- Early tasks focus on user-facing features before internal tooling
- Each task includes validation/testing as part of the implementation
- Documentation is treated as a first-class deliverable
